#  My Blog is fire

So often I thought about what a blog is. Years has passed since I heard of the word and read blogs writen by others. Today, by chance I am lead to create one for this specific project and rather than putting it away I have taken the challenge. I know writing is not my strogest suit yet when chances like this appear out of nowhere what can am I supposed do? 

For today, I decided to refelect on the idea that Github gives me the sense of moving into a new house. It is a new place that I have to get to know all the turns that lead to the front door. The people that live around the house. 

there was no point to this explanation except that unlike moving into a new place where I can bravely take the first step to discovering the area surounding my new place. With git hub there was a true challenge that made the process of clicking anything would be none sense. Then I cam across these skills guide. they are so helpful and all of a sudden I am writing a blog.
